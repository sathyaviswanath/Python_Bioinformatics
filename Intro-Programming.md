# **What is Programming?**
Programming is the process of expressing logical steps and data manipulation in a formal language so a computer can perform tasks. It transforms requirements and algorithms into executable instructions (source code).

## **Types of programming**

- **Procedural / Imperative:** Focus on procedures/ functions that performs step by step (C, Java, Python).
- **Object-oriented (OOP):** Models data (code)  and behavior as objects with encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism (Java, C++, Python).
- **Functional:** Treats computation as evaluation of functions, emphasis on immutability and higher-order functions (Haskell, Scala, parts of Python).
- **Declarative:** Describe what to achieve, not how (SQL, HTML, configuration languages).
- **Logic / Constraint:** Based on formal logic used for solving complex problems (Prolog).
- **Scripting / Glue:** Short programs to automate tasks or combine components (Bash, Python scripts).
- **Concurrent / Parallel:** Constructs for multiple threads/processes and synchronization.

## **Key concepts (core building blocks)**

- **Variables**(Stores data) and **Data types** (Specifies the kind of data - primitive and composite).
- **Functions -** A block of code that performs a specific task which can be reused.
- **Loops -** Repetition of a block of codes for multiple times (eg: for, while).
- **Conditionals -** Make decisions based on certain conditions (if-else statements).
- **Arrays/Lists -** Stores multiple values in a single variable.
- **Objects** (instance of class) and **Classes** (contain data & methods).

## **Why Programming is needed?**

- Automate repetitive or complex tasks.
- Solve real-world problems (business, science, engineering).
- Make systems reliable, reproducible and scalable.
- Enable interaction with data, hardware and networks.
- Deliver software products (websites, apps, devices, analyses).

## **How programming works? — Basic process and key components**

- **Requirements:** Define what must be done.
- **Design:** Choose data structures and algorithms; architecture.
- **Implementation:** Write source code in chosen language(s).
- **Build/Compile:** Translate source into executable (compilation or bundling).
- **Test:** Unit, integration, system, acceptance tests.
- **Debug and profile:** find and fix defects and bottlenecks.
- **Deploy:** Release to users or devices.
- **Maintain:** Update, fix, extend.

### **Key runtime components:**

- **Source code** - Writing by programmer (Human readable program)
- **Compiler/Interpreter:** Converts source to machine code or executes it.
- **Standard library and external libraries:** Prebuilt functionality.
- **Runtime environment:** Executes program (JVM, Python runtime).

## **Applications of Programming**

1. Web development (front-end, back-end, APIs).
2. Mobile apps (iOS, Android).
3. Desktop software and GUI apps.
4. Embedded systems and firmware (IoT devices).
5. Data science, analytics, machine learning, bioinformatics.
6. Scientific computing and simulations.
7. Automation, scripting, and DevOps.
8. Games and interactive media.
9. Financial systems, enterprise software, CRM/ERP.
10. Security tools, cryptography, networking.

# **Algorithm**

**Definition:** An algorithm is a finite, well-defined sequence of steps that takes input(s) and produces output(s) to solve a specific problem.

## **Key properties:**

- **Finiteness:** Must terminate after a finite number of steps.
- **Definiteness (unambiguity):** Each step is precisely defined.
- **Input:** Zero or more inputs are externally supplied.
- **Output:** At least one output produced that solves the problem.
- **Correctness:** Produces correct results for all valid inputs.
- **Termination:** Guarantees completion rather than infinite loop.
- **Determinism (usually):** Same input yields same output (some algorithms are nondeterministic).
- **Efficiency:** Measured in time and space (complexity).
- **Generality:** Applicable to a class of problem instances.
- **Robustness:** Handles edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.
